Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Donald Trump is the 
YUGEST name in American politics right now. And his campaign slogan 
"Make America Great Again" is equally amazing. So, in the spirit of 
fun, I've built this site to throw together a random collection of 
adjectives and objects to create entirely NEW phrases to show exactly 
WHAT impact Trump is having on America. Enjoy!

## About

I made this website as a practice exercise after going through the
[Single Serving PHP Sites](http://www.lynda.com/PHP-tutorials/Easy-PHP-Projects-Single-Serving-Sites/418850-2.html)
course on [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com). 

This is NOT a pro-Trump site. However, I have purposely tried to avoid extremely 
negative words within the random sentence generator. This site is meant for FUN
and not to be taken too seriously. 

### Randomized Elements

* Background pattern, colors, & design
* Color scheme (American style)
* Font family & size
* Image of Trump
* The sentence (you can choose the dictionary to use)

### Available Dictionaries

* [Default Dictionary](http://www.momswhothink.com/reading/adjectives-that-start-with-a-to-z-list.html) - using adjectives from the linked article on MomsWhoThink.com
* [Donald's Dictionary](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/donalds-dictionary.html) - words from the NY Magazine article
